### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

    Lab 2 part 1 was fun as it was an early introduction to actual coding. It was very doable but more challenging than part one, and successfully completing it made me feel a great sense of accomplishment whenever I sucessfully ran my code.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7 part 2 was also interesting and challenging. A lot of the effort came from trying to figure out the technicalities with the times that I missed, such as a time ending at 8:00pm and trying to figure out if it was supposed to include said time. I spent a couple hours finishing it up at home, but was incredibly satisfying when I finally managed to get it all correct. I also gained a deeper appreciation for programs that can flexibly display these times with a set input, instead of having to hard code it into the program.

    Lab 7 part 1 was also fun as it was an expansion upon an earlier program that we had done, and really enforced the idea that there are many alternate ways to get a program to do something. It made me think deeply about other labs and alternative ways I could have coded it to get the desired result.
